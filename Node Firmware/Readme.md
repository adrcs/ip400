# Node Firmware
This directory contains the code sources. The current source code is at Rev level 1.4.

The two zip files are the Cube IDE projects, which can be imported directly. See the .pdf instructions for 
more details. The IP400 code is common to both, and can be compiled for the two platforms.

The precompiled .bin file is for the mini-nodes that were recently shipped, the module can be updated using
stm32flash, which is located in the 'code' directory on the SD card image. This can be downloaded from the IP400
project site. To find it, go to ip400.adrcs.org, then to the Hardware page, scroll to the bottom to find the link
to the getting started page.
