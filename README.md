Welcome to the IP400 project. 

The directories here have been restructured. The Node Firmware directory contains the hardware abstraction for several platforms, 
and the IP400 directory contains source code that is common to all node types. There are precompiled binary files that can be
uploaded using the STM flash utility.

The Raspberry Pi code is now available on the disk image, which can be downloaded from the project website, ip400.adrcs.org, 
from the 'Getting Started' link on the hardware page.

The current revision level is 1.3

See the release notes in the 'IP400 Node Software' document.
