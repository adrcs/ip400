Welcome to the IP400 project. 

The directories here have been restructured. The Node Firmware directory contains the hardware abstraction for several platforms, 
and the source directory contains code that is common to all.

The platform code and precompiled binaries have been temporarily removed, due to a new repease of the CubeIDE from ST, and 
a pending new release of the node firmware.

The Raspberry Pi code is now available on the disk image, which can be downloaded from the project website, ip400.adrcs.org, 
from the 'Getting Started' link on the hardware page.

The current revision level is 1.0

See the release notes in the 'IP400 Node Software' document.
