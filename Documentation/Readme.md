# Documentation

This folder contains the recent documentation for the following:
1) IP400 Nucleo CC2 Experimenter node
2) IP400 Pi HAT Mini Node
3) IP400 SPI Specification
4) IP400 Node Software
5) Remote Power Kit Assembly Tips and Hints.

The two node types, teh Nucleo and Mini-Node, both run the same firmware so the functionality is the same. The hardware differences are highlighted in the 
relevant documentation.
The SPI specification describes the protocol for frames sent and received using the SPI interface, there is code to manage it on the SD card image, which 
can be found on the IP400 project website,  under hardware and 'getting started'.
The remote power kit assembly is a step-by-step set of instructions to assemble to power adapters. These are reasonably simple to assemble and can be done in
less that an hour.

WARNING: The regulator on the node gets hot, try not to touch it and ensure that it has adequate ventilation. A heatsink may be a good addition.
